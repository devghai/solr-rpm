# solr-rpm

## Introduction

RPM packaging instructions and scripts to package Solr server for
enterprise use.

## Usage

Code to build an RPM for Apache Solr 5.x.x+ on Red Hat and derivative OSes.

To use, first setup your development environment by running

    sudo ./setup.sh

Once that is done you can build an RPM by running

    ./build.sh 5.3.0 mycompany

Install the built RPM using

    sudo yum install -y /path/to/solr.rpm

By default, the solr service is not started as the user might want to make
some changes to configs or cores, but is registered to automatically start
when the machine establishes network connection when starting up. You can
start the service as follows

    sudo systemctl start solr-server

And stop it using

    sudo systemctl stop solr-server

The `solr` and `post` scripts are packaged too and put in `/usr/local/bin`,
which means they will be available on CLI like any other application. For
example, you can check solr health using 

    solr healthcheck -c <collection> -z <zkHost>

Although you can stop solr-server using `solr stop`, it is *NOT* recommended.
Because:

1. Once `solr stop` is issued, server will stop and cleanly exit but will 
likely not clean the PID file (unless `sudo` is used).
2. If Solr cleanly exits, `systemctl` will not detect a stop and will not
try to restart it, but will remain in `active (exited)` state.
3. Above two points mean PID file will point to a killed process.
4. Issuing `systemctl stop solr-server` after `solr stop` will fail the stop
process and will only clean the PID file. You can normally start after that.

## Directory tree

1. All configs (except that of embeded Jetty), including cores,
lives in `/etc/solr`.
2. Unlike the distribution, data is supposed to live in `/srv/solr` so that
you can have configs completely separate from data and have data live on
some other drive/partition if need be. Upstream Solr distribution tightly
couples where cores configs and its data lives.
3. Constants/environment variables are defined in `/etc/default/solr.in.sh`.
4. SystemD definition lives at `/lib/systemd/system/solr-server.service`.
5. Binaries live in `/usr/local/solr-<version>` with `/usr/local/solr`
pointing to it as a symlink.
6. `solr` and `post` scripts are packaged and live in `/usr/local/bin`.
Because of their path, these scripts will be available after installation.
Please see notes regarding using `solr start` and `solr stop` in previous
section.

## Notes for packagers

1. Constants defined at the top of spec file should tell you where most of 
the things go.
2. SystemD service definition has placeholders defined (they start with RPM_) 
that are replaced with constants defined in spec file. The same constants are
used to put values in `solr.in.sh`. This makes it easy to reorganize
installation without figuring out what patches are supposed to do, and also
make us a little impervious to upstream changes.
3. This spec file only packages the `server`, `licenses` and `bin` directories 
from official Solr archive. The full distribution contains full javadocs in 
HTML, bunch of plugins, distribution JARs and examples that are normally not 
needed in enterprise deployments.
4. Code in this repo has been tested on CentOS 7.3 to package 6.4.x Solr.
Packaging 5.x.x should work, but has not been tested. Please feel free to make
pull requests for bugs that you find. Ongoing support is not guaranteed.
5. The spec file currently puts Java 1.8 in dependencies. If you are packaging
older versions, it might be better to change that to whatever is applicable
for that release.
