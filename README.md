# solr-rpm
Code to build an RPM for Apache Solr 5.x.x

First setup your development environment by running

    ./setup.sh

Once that is done you can build an RPM by running

    ./build.sh 5.3.0 1

The version '5.3.0' can be replaced with any released version of Solr in the 5.x.x series.  The '1' is the version of the RPM itself.
